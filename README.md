At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git.
Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.

GitHub CLI is a command-line tool that brings pull requests, issues, GitHub Actions,
and other GitHub features to your terminal, so you can do all your work in one place.
